# Code Assassin Source Code

[![Programs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Programs-1-informational.svg)](https://github.com/Abesuden/Code-Assassin/blob/master/src/CoreProcess.exe)
[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dependencies-3-informational.svg)](https://github.com/Abesuden/Code-Assassin/blob/master/src/appDecoder.ps1)

The core module and other dependency programs can be found within this directory.

```
CodeAssassin.bat
CoreProcess.exe
appDecoder.ps1
LangLib.txt
```
## Description

The `CodeAssassin.bat` is the program you will run to kick off the program. Everything else will be run and handled by the initial `CodeAssassin.bat` program. The language library is what will be displayed to the user and will show what lanugages are supported.

The **Core Process** is a core program that utilizes the language modules to perform the assitive programing with any integrated development environment (*IDE*). The `appDecoder.ps1` is a dependency you will need to have in the same directory as the **Core Process**.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Supported operating systems:

```
Windows 10
```

What software you will need to install and how to install it:

```
Code Assassin
Code Assassin Language Module(s)
```

### Installing

A step by step guide on how to set up the project on your local machine.

Pull/download the Code Assassin programs called:

```
CodeAssassin.bat
CoreProcess.exe
appDecoder.ps1
LangLib.txt
```

Install all desired language modules found [here](https://github.com/Abesuden/Code-Assassin/tree/master/languageModules)

## Deployment

This program uses language modules in the form of plug and play, where a user can download a new language module and drop it right into the Code Assassin file and have access to a new programming language support.
