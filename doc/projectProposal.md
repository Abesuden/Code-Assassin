# Software Engineering Project Proposal

### Scenario

- UNF has been using the Oracle stack for the past 10 years
- Recently they have migrated to the .NET stack
- In addition, UNF has recently hired 5 new employees
- In order to facilitate new employees' transition to the new software stack, UNF has tasked our group with developing software that will allow employees to quickly adapt to, and develop with, the new programming stack

### Proposal

The Code Assassins application assists developers with implementing the syntax of multiple programming languages. The application will identify the developers IDE workflow and intput the correct syntax using a succinct alias library. The program is used to accomplish specific tasks within each respective language (i.e. print, initialize/declare variable, build array/list, ect.).
