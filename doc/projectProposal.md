The Code Assassins application assists developers with implementing the syntax of multiple programming languages. The application will identify the developers IDE workflow and intput the correct syntax using a succinct alias library. The program is used to accomplish specific tasks within each respective language (i.e. print, initialize/declare variable, build array/list, ect.).
