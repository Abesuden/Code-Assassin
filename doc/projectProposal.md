# Software Engineering Project Proposal

### Scenario
You have been asked to lead a software development team to build a system fulfilling the Statement of Need below. You and your team are employees of a software development company, under contract to the Information Technology Services (ITS) department of University of North Florida (UNF). The project must balance reasonable system cost, development effort, timely delivery, software quality, and functionality. UNF has been using the Oracle stack for the past 10 years and recently, they have migrated to the .NET stack. In addition, UNF has recently hired 5 new employees. In order to facilitate new employees' transition to the new software stack, UNF has tasked a local consulting group (Code Assassins) with developing software that will allow employees to quickly adapt to, and develop with, the new programming stack. Due to the rushed, and yet, critical nature of the given scenario, UNF has stressed the importance of simple development and rapid deployment of the application. Should additional features be required in the future, they will be implemented as updates to the existing deployed platform. The initial version of the application will be soley focused on increasing the productivity of UNF developers.

### Statement of Need

UNF is in need of a system that will provide a streamlined approach for employees to begin developing software using unfamiliar programming languages. Due to the strict nature of UNF's expectations of developers, they are hoping to avoid the lag time that is commonly associated with migrating to a new programming stack. Such a system should meet the following...

**requirements**:
* Quickly and efficiently perform common software operations in various languages using predefined aliases
* Select the programming language to be used for the respective IDE session
* Interface with the respective IDE that the developer decides to use
* Run on windows 10
* Support Java, C#, Rust, and Golang

### Proposal

The Code Assassins application assists developers with implementing the syntax of multiple programming languages. The application will identify the developers IDE workflow and input the correct syntax using a succinct alias library. The program is used to accomplish specific tasks within each respective language (i.e. print, initialize/declare variable, build array/list, ect.).
